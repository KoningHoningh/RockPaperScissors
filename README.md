In this assignment I have learned how to make a for-loop. With the experience
from Python this is a little different. I hope I can reduce the mixups to a 
minimum. I have also had the opportunity to practice with the if-loop in
JavaScript. Also I have gotten a little more used to the console and JavaScript
in general and github. I should not forget to upload this file to github after
reviewing. 

I can still improve a lot, which is good. I had to google a lot too, which is
also good. I am getting more used to writing functions, which is also good.

I can improve on my code formatting. And I hope that in the future I can mix
JavaScript together with CSS and HTML to create a nice functioning website,
like I have seen some people in the examples had done.
